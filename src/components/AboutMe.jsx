        <p className="lead mb-4">
         Hi, Iâ€™m Lia ðŸ‘‹ For over 7 years, Iâ€™ve been the go-to person for solving tech hiccups and keeping systems running smoothly. Along the way, I discovered a love for web development â€” the creative side of tech that lets me bring ideas to life. Today, Iâ€™m blending the patience and problem-solving of IT support with the creativity of coding, while continuously learning and exploring. My dream is to build something meaningful for people to use, combining my passion for helping others with my passion for creating through technology.
